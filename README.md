# [Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)] (https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

## About

I purchased this Vue course from Udemy to effiently learn Vue.js for Frontend Software Engineering. After this course, I will learn to use TypeScript with Vue.js

### The Purpose

I am learning Vue.js beause I wish to become a more rounded Frontend SE and I understand that for some bigger projects using React.js is not suitable since React.js is
a lightweight Javascript library rather than a framework with routing out of the box.

### How To Run My Apps

To run my Add Goals app, simply doble click on the index.html file, and the app will appear in your default browser. To use this app, type your goal into the input field, and click the Add Goal button which is translated into traditional Chinese as I will invite my mother to test out my app and give me some feedback.
