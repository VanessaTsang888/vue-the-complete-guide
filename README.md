# Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)

## About

I purchased this Vue course from Udemy to effiently learn Vue.js for Frontend Software Engineering. The link to this course is: https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/
After this course, I will learn to use TypeScript so that I can use this with Vue.js to develop applications with type safety.
All my notes and code with my comments are on my GitHub and my aim to commit my work at least once during my training day to keep my work safe in the cloud and for anyone to view my work and for me to share my work with others.

Every time I have developed a Vue application, I will take a screenshot of that and save it inside the directory named: myScreenshots. This way anyone who wish to see what my app look like in the UI before they run my app then this is possible.

### The Purpose

I am learning Vue.js beause I wish to become a more rounded Frontend SE and I understand that for some bigger projects using React.js is not suitable since React.js is
a lightweight Javascript library rather than a framework with routing out of the box.

### How To Run My Apps

To run my Add Goals app, simply download the project directory named: gs-01-starting-project. Then double click on the index.html file, and the app will appear in your default browser. To use this app, type your goal into the input field, and click the Add Goal button which is translated into traditional Chinese as I will invite my mother to test out my app and give me some feedback.
