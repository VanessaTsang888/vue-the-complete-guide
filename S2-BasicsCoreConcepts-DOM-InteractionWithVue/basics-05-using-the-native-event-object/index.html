      <!-- pointing at the method fullname from the computed property not executing it so not using the parenthesis. This fullname will be connected to the fullname computed property 'fullname()' within JS code. So Vue will execute that for us, check if there is a full name data property, if not will check if there is a computed property with that name, if that's the case it will execute it. -->
